This Garbage Collection Management System is a web-based software that was written using PHP, 
MySQL Database, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap, and some other plugins/libraries. 
It stores the list of the company's clients and records of waste collections. 
This will help the garbage collector business to automate their records and payment management.
